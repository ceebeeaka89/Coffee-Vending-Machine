# Coffee vending Machine

# Background
Welcome to the Coffee Machine App, a simple Python program that simulates a coffee machine. The app allows users to select a drink, check if there are enough resources to make the drink, and handle coin transactions to pay for the drink.

# Features
- Drink Selection: Choose from three coffee options: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
- Resource Management: The machine checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee) to make the selected drink.
- Coin Processing: The user inputs the number of coins they are inserting to pay for the drink, and the app calculates if the payment is sufficient.
- Resource Deduction: After making a drink, the resources are updated to reflect the ingredients used.
- Change Calculation: If the user inserts more money than needed, the app calculates and returns the change.

# Future Enhancements
- Adding More Drinks: Expand the menu to include more coffee varieties.
- Refill Functionality: Allow the user to refill resources when they run out.
- GUI Version: Develop a graphical user interface for easier interaction.
